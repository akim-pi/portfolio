## Projects
**Temporal Data Imputation Model for Peatland Groundwater Level** _(2023)_  
[Github](https://github.com/akim-pi/peatland-reconstruction)
- Conducted missing data analysis on peatland groundwater level time series data at Rimba Panjang.
- Performed time series data reconstruction/imputation with LOCF, NOCB, Moving Average, Interpolation, Kalman Filter, K-nn Imputation and Simple Averaging Ensemble using imputeTS and VIM from R.
- Working with 3 atributes namely groundwater level, soil moisture and rainfall to forecast groundwater level.
- Reconstructed data are then predicted using three types of LSTM namely Vanilla LSTM, Stacked LSTM and Bi-directional LSTM using **Tensorflow**, Numpy and Pandas from Python.
